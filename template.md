# API Blueprint RFC XXXX: RFC Template

## Table of Contents

- [Abstract](#abstract)
- [Motivation](#motivation)
- [Rationale](#rationale)
- [Backwards Compatibility](#backwards-compatibility)

Once you've made a copy of this template, remove this abstract, fill out the
metadata above and the sections below, then submit the RFC. Follow the
guidelines in RFC 1.

## Abstract

This should be a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being
addressed.

This (and the above metadata) is the only section strictly required to submit a
draft RFC; the following sections can be barebones and fleshed out as you work
through the RFC process.

## Motivation

This section should explain why this RFC is needed. The motivation is critical
for RFCs that want to add substantial new features or materially refactor
existing ones. It should clearly explain why the existing solutions are
inadequate to address the problem that the RFC solves. RFC submissions without
sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Rationale

This section should flesh out out the specification by describing what
motivated the specific design design and why particular design decisions were
made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related
work.

The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and
discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility

If this RFC introduces backwards incompatibilities, you must must include this
section. It should describe these incompatibilities and their severity, and
what mitigation you plan to take to deal with these incompatibilities.
